# Movie Success Prediction

This project predicts the success of a movie based on various factors like budget, cast, genre, and production company using machine learning.

## Features
- Data collection and preprocessing
- Feature engineering and selection
- Training multiple machine learning models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Evaluation of model performance

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Ashish1455/Movie-Success-Prediction.git
   cd Movie-Success-Prediction
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the analysis:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## Dataset
- The dataset includes information on various movies, their box office earnings, and other features.

## Usage
- Train a new prediction model or use a pre-trained model to analyze movie success probabilities.
- Adjust hyperparameters in `config.py` for tuning.

## Results
- The model provides a success probability for movies based on input features.
- Various evaluation metrics such as RMSE, RÂ² score, and accuracy are used to assess model performance.
